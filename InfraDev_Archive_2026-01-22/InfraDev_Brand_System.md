# InfraDev.Africa — Brand System (working truth)

**Date:** 2026-01-22  
**Source of truth:** current InfraDev website codebase (Tailwind config + UI), plus brandpack PDFs generated in this project.  
**Design intent:** Institution-ready (DFIs, lenders, ministries), but not bureaucratic. Dark, premium, clean, “decision-grade”.

---

## 1) Brand idea

### Positioning (plain)
InfraDev makes infrastructure projects **investable and implementable** by turning concepts into **decision-ready feasibility, bankability, and delivery structures**.

### Brand persona
- Institutional-grade: rigorous, measured, evidence-led.
- Solutionist: pragmatic, execution-oriented.
- Africa-context fluent: acknowledges coordination constraints, data gaps, governance realities.

### Signature line
- EN: The Solutionists for Infrastructure.
- FR: Les “Solutionists” de l’infrastructure.

---

## 2) Visual identity tokens

### 2.1 Core colors
- Primary / Warm Gold: `#F9C70C`
- Navy / Deep Base: `#0A1F44`
- Navy Light / Surface: `#1A2538`

### 2.2 Neutral palette (recommended)
- Text primary: `#FFFFFF`
- Text secondary: `#D1D5DB`
- Text muted: `#9CA3AF`
- Borders: `rgba(255,255,255,0.06)` to `0.12`
- Gold glow: `rgba(249,199,12,0.25)` to `0.40`

### 2.3 Contrast rules (non-negotiable)
- On navy surfaces, body text should be **gray-200/300**, not gray-400.
- For small text (<12pt), prefer **AA contrast**.
- Avoid gold text on light backgrounds.

---

## 3) Typography system

### Website fonts
- Display: Montserrat (700–800)
- Headings: Poppins (600–700)
- Body: Inter (300–500)

### Office-safe fallback
- Display/Headings: Segoe UI Semibold (or Calibri Bold)
- Body: Segoe UI / Calibri

---

## 4) Logo system

### 4.1 Primary mark
- Gold rounded square, rotated ~+3°, containing “ID.” in navy.

### 4.2 Wordmark colors
- Infra = white
- Dev = gold
- .Africa = gray-400

### 4.3 Clear space + minimums
- Clear space: at least 1× square height around the lockup.
- Minimum (digital): mark alone 24px; lockup 140px wide.

### 4.4 Do / Don’t
Do: use on navy backgrounds, use square mark for avatars/favicons.  
Don’t: recolor “Dev”, place wordmark on noisy backgrounds without overlay, remove the tilt.

---

## 5) Iconography + backgrounds
- Material Symbols outline style is aligned to the brand.
- Background grammar: soft radial glows + faint grid lines + dot matrices.
- Rule: present but not noisy (“infrastructure schematics at night”).

---

## 6) Layout + components (the InfraDev look)
- Big radii: 24–48px.
- Hairline borders, subtle shadows.
- CTAs: gold pill buttons, uppercase micro label, wide tracking.
- Cards: navy-light surfaces, hover border brightening + mild lift.

---

## 7) Bilingual rules
EN is default; FR is equal quality. Keep hierarchy identical, avoid bureaucratic French.

---

## 8) Fixes implied by feedback
- Keep v1.0 visual richness but enforce AA contrast on gradient sections and fine print.
- Standardize bullet indentation via template styles (Word/PPT).
